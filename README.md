# Password-Strength-Checker-in-python
I made a password strength checker in python, that also checks 100k common passwords to see if it is on the list. 


## Objective


In this project, the Password Strength Checker, I utilized Python coding language to create a robust tool aimed at enhancing password security. Through Python's flexibility and efficiency, I developed a program that not only evaluates the strength of passwords but also provides actionable insights on how users can bolster their security. Additionally, the tool incorporates a comprehensive database of 100,000 common passwords, enabling users to quickly identify and avoid weak or easily guessable choices. By leveraging Python's capabilities, this project aims to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools necessary to fortify their online accounts against potential threats.
